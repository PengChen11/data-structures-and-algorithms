## Get started

Given an array of N items and L = 0, Selection Sort will:

1. Find the position X of the smallest item in the range of [L...Nâˆ’1],

2. Swap X-th item with the L-th item,

3. Increase the lower-bound L by 1 and repeat Step 1 until L = N-2.

## Big O

Since this is next loop, so big O is O(n^2) all the time.
