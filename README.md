# Javascript data structures and algorithms practice for code 301 and 401

Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout Code Fellows 301 and 401 courses, I will complete a set of daily code challenges.

The 2nd 401 course with Code Fellows was JavaScript. The 1st time was done in Python, [click here to see the repo](https://github.com/PengChen11/python-data-structures-and-algorithms)

Now it comes to the 3rd time, with Java. Each little challenges will be updated to include Java code in it.

When doing these challenges this time, a few months after I started the Python 401 class,  I realized that my thought process is changed in the great way. This time some of my solutions are way much more efficient in O(time) and O(space).

## 301 Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Will be listed shortly. They're just tricks to use JS built in methods.
